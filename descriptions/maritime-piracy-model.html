  <h2>Global Maritime Piracy – Hexbin Density Analysis</h2>

  <p>
    This project visualized the global distribution of maritime piracy incidents using Anti-shipping Activity Messages (ASAM) provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s Maritime Safety Information portal. The incidents were aggregated over a hexagonal grid to create a density map that highlighted piracy hotspots across international waters.<br><br>

    The geoprocessing model, developed in QGIS, followed these key steps:<br>
    — The incident point data was reprojected into an equal-area coordinate system.<br>
    — A global hexagonal grid was generated based on a defined cell size.<br>
    — Grids intersecting at least one piracy incident were selected.<br>
    — Piracy incidents were counted within each selected hexagon.<br><br>

    This approach enabled a clearer understanding of piracy patterns and supported risk evaluation for maritime safety operations.
